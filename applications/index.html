					<h2>Motivation</h2>
				</div>
				<p> I am a student of Masters, Software Technology. Internet has fascinated me since ages and web sites are the gateway to the much complex internet. It is where even the novice user's first point to contact. In early days of internet, browsers were not so user friendly and the design of the sites were too contemporary. While modern day users demand a lot of visual treat to their content and want responsiveness to their pages as variety of devices have come in market. To be a better designer and developer, I should be ready to satisfy the expectations of today's consumer. This work shop will be a great place for me to learn the latest trends in web development which made me create this application. </p>

					<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
				</div>
				<p>The most challenging part I faced when developing a web site was developing a scalable site. With the increased number of accesses, the responsiveness and availability of the site decreases. I really wanted to learn how to develop a scalable website. The next challenge I faced was the compatibility issues of the developed site. Some pages work properly in most browsers while some browsers don't support all site. I want to learn how to develop a site which could work hassle free in all browsers. These are some of the challenges I faced and there are many more doubts for me in the field of web development which I could clarify in this workshop.  </p>
