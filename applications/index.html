  			<button class="button">Why do you want to be part of this program? <br><p>I want to be part of this program because I am thriving to learn web development. With basic knowledge of frontend and Javascript, I am exploring opportunities and possibilities of web development. Before, my concept about web development was limited to websites. When I started learning web development starting from this summer after summer break from my university, I figured out that web development is more than websites. As web application solve the problem of multiplatforms, web applications are being very popular these days. For a person like me with vast interest in startup ecosystem and small business, web based apps can play important role to deliver awesome services and solve real world problems with minimum budget and yet reachable from all around the world. This really  inspire me to be part of this program. I hope to make impact to my community with whatever I will learn from this program.  </p></button>
  		
  					
  			

  			<button class="button">My biggest Challenge <br> <p>I am always searching for challanges and opportunities where I can feel free to fail yet end up winning as you always learn something even you fail. The best place to do this for me are hackathon events. My biggest challange was to develop the frontend side of a blockchain project called "Fairhousing" in Blockchain Pioneers Hackathon, Berlin. I was never in situation where I have to work with experienced backend developer in his speed, having null knowledge to design the whole thing from scratch. But when you are in situation and time limit where you are pushed to do something, you don't know how but you ended up doing that anyway. Before 24 hours, I had no idea how to make the frontend side and after 24 hours I ended up doing it and our project worked perfectly. This was my biggest challange so far. I want more challanges and want to ended up saying, this program as my biggest challange at the end of the summer camp.</p></button>
