                    <p>
                        My name is Sidsel Qvistgaard Imer, I’m a 22 years old student, from Denmark.
                        <br /> As per June 2018, I got my diploma as an, officially educated Multimedia designer. 
                        <br /> In which my focus, has been programming, mainly front-end but, 
                        <br />with a keen interest in back-end. 
                     And after the summer ends, I am going to be studying Web development at UCN, a top up program that only let 16 Danish students in, that will help me build on my education and knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short term. I am an extremely structured detail-oriented person, 
                        <br />with a passion for web development
                    </p>

                            <p>I want to be apart of this summer school, because even though I have only been, programming for a little under two years, in which I have been introduced to different languages, from JavaScript to C#. I know Web development is a big passion of mine. I love exploring new techniques and ways of doing things. I feel like this summer school will help me, develop my skills and help me prepare for, studying web development this upcoming semester. </p>

                            <h2>My biggest Challenge</h2>
                            <p>My biggest challenge so far, is that because I am so new but do have a degree, in which we learn programming but in a short amount of time. I feel like there is so much I don’t know, and that I could optimize my websites better, and increase the knowledge, I already have with this course. Because every time I make a new site I always explore try new techniques my final multimedia exam I went over curriculum, by making a site with a headless CMS, JSON, AJAX, API and restful API. </p>
