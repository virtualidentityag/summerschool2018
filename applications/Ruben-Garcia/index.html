  <h1 class="centering greendark">MY NAME IS</h1>
  <p class="textbox1 round1 niceleftborder font20 boxshadow">
	  My name is Rubén García, I have always been amazed by how technology is changing the world.

A lot of people think that websites are just a platform for communication, but for web developers this is the core of communication, and that is why we have been seeing a lot of tools, libraries and resources on the market, which integrate one another.
     
For people like us, who want to use this technology to make a better world and help save time and money, websites aren’t not a simple thing, on the contrary the complexity is huge, that is why the domain of all these tools is too big that is necessary to use software engineering approaches to maintain a good perspective over it and to not lose control.

We have seen too that these programme's code, contain vulnerabilities due to which companies face threats everyday, cased somehow by themselves. The security of the aforementioned "just web pages" plays a critical role. When we talk about security, webpages cease being the face but becoming the heart of a business.
Webpages are a giant market with users expecting more and more from developers like us. New horizons are being explored in the field of Human Computer interaction.
We are being part of a change of direction without any return. Nowadays, artificial intelligence techniques are being injected into many aspects of science.
Web and AI, two domains that at first glance look different, are being combined nowadays.
What a fascinating world! All of this lead me to ask myself:

and to reinforce it doing that; to improve and to grow more and more. I know that this event will help me to meet great professionals.
Also, networking is also my passion. I would like to meet professionals in this field and share my experiences with them.

<!-- Challenge section -->	
<div class="container padding64" id="challenge">
	  <h1 class="centering greendark">WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE?</h1>
	  <!--space to write a nice sentence-->
	  <p class="textbox1 round1 niceleftborder font20 boxshadow">I was familiar working with frameworks such as Joomla, Wordpress, prestashop and so on where everything is provided as a functionality by other developers.
When using these platforms, I had been thinking that I was already a web developer, because of the ease of building nice web design.
          
Until one day, I got the opportunity to work in the Deutsche Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz (DFKI), where they used tools that I did not use before.
I was able to learn them really fast when I had to customize an old version of an app and rewrite the interface using polymer components. That was a lot of fun.
But the challenge came when, as a next step I was in charge of the development of a client for the GPII, a public incluse public platform, which helps
anyone who faces accessibility barriers to access and use any digital technology they encounter, regardless of their location. This was more challenging and
I learnt a lot, not only about the way to execute this project, but also about how technologies positively affect people's lives.
Working using new technologies is always a great challenge, but this last experience got me really involved! I liked it a lot and
that is why I am looking forward to grab a chance to enhance my skills and knowledge while sharing my experience as well.
