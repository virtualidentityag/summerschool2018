	        <p>My name is <i><b>Anna Noukou</b></i> and I've just completed my third academic year in Athens University of Economics and Business in Greece, Department of Informatics. I still have one more year to go. I have taken part and excelled in two IT competitions. Also contributed in the development of a mobile Application.</p>
	        <p> Within the period of the Erasmus for Your Entrepreneurs exchange in Spain, I was able to grow as a Developer, learn how marketing works, get guidance in technical issues like security,databases and develop international contacts.</p>

	        <p>You offer a deeper/better understanding of web technologies. Improving my code quality and learning more about backend is also important for me.</p>
	        <p>My goal is to extend my undergrad by some time and acquire real work experience. In order to achieve that I need to gather as much knowledge as possible. This experience will help me to become better and thus I will increase my competitiveness once I enter the workforce later on. Last but not least I want to get in touch with developers and your digital technologies to get an idea of how a team and a company works.</p>

	        <p>Theming a CMS website in Drupal was a real challenge for me. At that time I had only some basic knowledge of CSS and HTML. I had to make a beautiful design with flexible and customizable sections, easily adaptable and extendable.</p>
	        <p>Learning PHP was also very tough. I was trying to build my CMS, so I had to understand how databases, security, cookies etc. works in PHP.</p>
