<p> My name is Ilori Bolaji Daniels</p>
<p> Aside other tasks that one has to undertake towards becoming a rounded computer scientist, software application design and the likes have always been my interest. I am very 
convinced I enjoy every aspect of it, from frontend to backend development. I love seeing a very expressive interface that puts users at great comfort and a software that does virtually
all that is expected of it with manageable bugs. I have been trying to develop myself personally, however, with very little success due to other distractions and the lack of opportunity
to really grow. I believe two weeks fully dedicated to this course with like minds will go a long way in putting me where I desire to be.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge so far has been having a creative web interface idea but not necessarily having the skill to execute it. I want this to change!</p>
