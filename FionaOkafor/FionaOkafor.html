      <h2>Why I want to do the course</h2>
            <p>Over the last year and a half I have put everything into learning how to code. Something that I feared at school because I felt I wasn't good enough at maths to be able to understand a programming language.</p>

            <p>When I started studying Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA in Copenhagen, this fear was something I had to overcome and I found myself enjoying it and while I have a strong interest in UX Design and aesthetics I want to become an all round front end developer with an eye for design.</p>

            <p>The idea of the summer course is exciting and I would love to learn new skills in a fresh environment in an international group with others who are dedicated and eager to learn.</p>

                      <p>Munich is also a very beautiful city that I would love to experience.</p>

                             <h2>Biggest Coding Challenge</h2>
                                  <p>I made an website with classical ciphers which had to be coded using Javascript. This turned out to be a big challenge for me because I realised that I knew enough Javascript to make something happen on screen such as an animation or interactivity but I did not understand the logic behind it.</p>

            <p>I felt like I was back at the drawing board. So I went back and started to re-learn and understand the basics of Javascript. I read the book 'How to Think like a Programmer' by Paul Vickers and learnt about problem solving through a step by step process and started working out small problems, first on paper and planning it out before touching my laptop.</p>

            <p>In the end I was able to encode and decode a number of classical ciphers but it was my biggest challenge because it was humbling and it made me realise how much more there was to lern and how much more time and effort I had to invest in what I was learning.</p>
