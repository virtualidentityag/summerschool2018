  <div id="intro">
  <p> I am Prathyusha Pallapati. A master's student in Software Technology. During my childhood, I was fasinated to play the video game"Super Mario" and woundered how was it even possible.
    Later, when I grew up I was introduced to Computers, and my first programming language was<b> MSDOS</b>, I made a Turtle run for the first time in my life on a computer!!
    Coding to me is pure Magic and I have made up mind to be a Magican! It inspires me to see all letters, numbers and images to
    be put up nicely wrapped in a bundle and presented in an organized way.
    I began my professional education in the field of Computer Science and Engineering in India, and came to Germany to pursue Masters'.

 As I want to be a qualified web developer rather than just designing web pages, I acquired the basic knowledge from my studies and other online sources.  I utilized the knowledge to develop front end related projects which was a fine experience to see all my hardwork paid off on a browser. But, still I could not end up developing a more responsive and scalable application as I lack knowledge in webservices especially in micro services..
 <!-- The struggle to meet tiny details for the perfect representation, making a proper responsive webpage. Even thought  have handson experience with Java, JavaScript, Database Management Systems, Html5, CSS, -->

   <h4>Technologies known:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Html5</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Restwebservice</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What interests me for this camp?</h2>

<div >

  <a name="interest"></a>
<p> Firstly, the program structure which includes responsive web design, improving quality, building the architecture base for the webpage, serverless backend services with microservices.
And most importantly, spending dedicated two weeks of time and applying practically along with with diverse group will not only improve my coding skills, but also my thinking towards a problem and obtain a valuable exposure while working with a group of talents.
Last but not the least, its a free course with all guddies and i would be extremly glad to be a part of it.
<!-- This exposure to technology, will pave a proper foundation to achieve my dream to be a Web Developer. </p> -->
</div>
<h2>My Biggest Challenge:</h2>
<div >
  <a name="challenge">
  <p> As there are tons of front end frameworks already in the market and a new one arrives in each quarter, picking one for an application is troublesome.  Also, I am in need of gaining knowledge in services-part as I find difficult to choose SOAP, REST webservices or micro services for easy deployment and scalable feature in an application.  Hence gaining a overall knowledge about the web development and its technologies will give me the knowledge that I need now to be a qualified web developer</p>
